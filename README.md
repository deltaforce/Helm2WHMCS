This app is written in CFML and runs on Lucee on windows platform, which you can download from lucee.org


On windows, just do a bog standard installation using the installer.
Tell it to enable the connector on all sites.
Set *.cfm as a default document
put this folder into any website.
Edit the application.cfm and edit the varibles, there are comments in the file to explain what needs to be edited.
Now just browse to the app, the rest of the instructions are in the app itself.

I don't use Linux, and have not tested this on Linux, so it will likley have some of those annoying case sensitivity issues that occur on Linux/Apache web server.
