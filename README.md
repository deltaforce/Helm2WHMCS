This app is written in CFML and runs on Railo on windows platform, which you can download from www.getrailo.org

On windows, just do a bog standard installation using the installer.
Tell it to enable the connector on all sites.
Set *.cfm as a default document
put this folder into any website, and just browse to it, the rest of the instructions are in the app.

If you are on Linux, then sorry I cannot help you, I don't use Linux, and have not tested this on Linux, 
so it will likley have some of those annoying case sensitivity issues that occur on Linux/Apache web server.

If you find this app useful or want some support then please send me a Paypal donation via this link
